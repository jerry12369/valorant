		<h1>Game Introduction</h1>
      Background story <a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/VALORANT_Lore"target="_blank">Click here</a><br>
      The lore of VALORANT refers to the fictional universe that the game is set in, the histories of its characters and settings, and the stories/narratives that occur within. Each agent in the game has their own backstory, all united together under the VALORANT organizations that the game takes its name from. The primary narrative follows the perspective of the VALORANT Protocol agents of Alpha Earth.

The central conflict that the organization is a part of is reflected in VALORANT's core gameplay (one team seeking to detonate a spike and steal surrounding radianite, the other defending their homeland), but the games and round-by-round fights played by players are not canon themselves and have no effect on the lore. Not every aspect of gameplay is required to be justified and canonized into the lore, and gameplay does not need to adhere to how things would "realistically" (in the context of the VALORANT universe) function within canon lore, nor does it need to accurately reflect moments when agents are not presently "active" in the Protocol within the lore. Similarly, not everything related to the game's cosmetics is necessarily part of the lore either, as many collections use original characters in their art as part of that collection's own theme and narrative; historically, these characters have never been of any relevance to canon lore.<br
